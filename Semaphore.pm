package Semaphore;

=head1 NAME

Semaphore;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides semaphore file functionality allowing the
instantiator to acquire an exclusive lock on a semaphore file.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

use Sem;
my $sem = new Semaphore('/wherever/locks/thing.lock');
if ($sem) {
    # enjoy exclusive access to a resource ...
    $sem->unlock;
}
else {
  # try again later ...
  exit;
}

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------

=item new

Obtain an exclusive lock in a file in a non-blocking mode.  Failure to
obtain the lock means some other process has the lock. Making the file
handle local means that when the process exits, even it it fails to
call unlock due to runtime error, the lock will be released.

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my $file_spec = shift || die qq{filename missing in new Semaphore};
    
    die qq{file=$file_spec must be a disposable semaphore file (.sem)} 
      if ($file_spec !~ m,\.sem$,);
    
    # Linux locking using fcntl is advisory. We can open the file even
    # if locked but we won't be able to get a lock.
    open(my $fh, ">", $file_spec) || die qq{open failed on semaphore file="$file_spec": $!};

    if (flock($fh, LOCK_EX|LOCK_NB)) {
        chmod 0666, $file_spec;
	$fh->autoflush(1);
        print($fh $$);

                    'fh' => $fh,

        return $self;
    }
    else {
        close($fh);
    }

    return undef;

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------

=item unlock

Release the lock, delete the file

    # unlink will fail which is ok
