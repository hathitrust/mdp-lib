=head1 NAME

PIFiller (pif)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is an abstract class whose subclasses provide methods to
process the PIs for a given template.

Subclasses of this class inherit the PI_handler Perl attribute handler
herein which populates class data with the name of the PI handled and
the coderef of the handler method for later binding to the PIs in a
given template.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

The naming convention is

sub "handle_" . SOME_PI_NAME . "_PI" : PI_handler(SOME_PI_NAME)

So the COLL_LIST PI handler in an implementation of the PIFiller class
would be declared like this

sub handle_COLL_LIST_PI : PI_handler(COLL_LIST)
{
   my $self = shift;
   ...
}

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------

=item PI_handler : ATTR

Record the occurrence of a PI handler definition in a Action subclass
in the %PI_to_handler_map

PI handlers in subclasses of Root should be declared as described in the SYNOPSIS

Note: this very special subroutine runs very early in the CHECK phase
of compilation.  It is called by Perl not by the application as such.

=cut

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
my %PI_to_handler_map;
sub PI_handler
    :ATTR
{
    my ($package, $symbol, $PI_handler, $attr, $PI_name, $phase) = @_;

    $PI_to_handler_map{$PI_name} = $PI_handler;
}




# ---------------------------------------------------------------------

=item get_PI_handler_mapping

Return the map (hash) of PIs to PI handler code references.  Each PI
handler must use the special ATTR syntax to define which PI is is
designed to handle.

sub get_PI_handler_mapping
{
    my $self = shift;
    my $C = shift;
