=head1 NAME

Vendors

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package encapsulates code using FindBin to build a list of paths
containing 'lib/' so the calling script can find libraries,
Rails-style.

It essentially adds the following for each dir* to @INC

qw( lib vendor/dir1/lib vendor/dir2/lib vendor/dir3/foo/lib ... )

for as many subdirectories of vendor as exist containing lib plus the
lib sibling of cgi in the HTDE directory hierarchy scheme.

NOTE: it is possible to insert the entire directory tree for app1 as a
submodule in $SDRROOT/app2/vendor/"app1"/lib. In that case
the $SDRROOT/app1/lib would be added to the @INC for app2, in effect, sharing
some of app1's lib code with app2.

DEVELOPMENT NOTE: If the development of app1 involves development of
mdp-lib code, it is cumbersome to get the mdp-lib code changes into
the $SDRROOT/app1/vendor/common-lib/lib directory, e.g. for foo.pm:

1) stage and commit foo.pm to local mdp-lib local repo
2) push local change to repos/mdp-lib.git central repo
3) cd app1/vendor/common-lib/lib && pull

This forces commits just to run app1 for unit testing.

Vendors.pm has a debug switch to short-cut this process. If
debug=local is set, $SDRROOT/mdp-lib is added to @INC before the
vendor libs.  The app code will see code in $SDRROOT/mdp-lib before it
sees the app/vendor submodule code.
